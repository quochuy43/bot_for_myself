# Memorable moments in life
My 21 years old had many memorable moments. But I will tell you the 3 most memorable moments:
- Receiving the prize for excellent math student in grade 4. It was special because in grade 3 I took the exam with very low scores, and the result of grade 4 made me happy
- My father called when I found out my university entrance exam results. I didn't dare to answer the phone. After knowing the results, I was depressed for nearly 2 weeks. Thanks to my family, close friends and lover, I was able to lift my spirits. That is a memory I will never forget
- Quarantined at home during the covid 19 outbreak in 2022. I also had sinusitis so it was very bad. But I'm happy because I have many memories of studying online.

# Health and Physical Well-being
Although I play a lot of sports and live a very healthy life, I was born with a weak immune system and have illnesses such as sinusitis and stomach pain. I have been infected with Covid 19, so if I play sports too hard, I will have shortness of breath.
